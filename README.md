# network-anomaly-detection
This project develops and evaluates a Random Forest-based intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect anomalies in network traffic data. The work focuses on handling imbalanced datasets, preprocessing large-scale network features, and testing GPU acceleration for scaling machine learning workflows.

Achieved 87% accuracy.
